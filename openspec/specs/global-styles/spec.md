# global-styles Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change implement-homepage. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: A shared styles directory MUST be created at the monorepo root for CSS variables and common styles accessible to all apps

A centralized `/shared/styles/` directory SHALL house CSS variables and design tokens that can be imported by any app in the monorepo, enabling consistent styling across different tech stacks.

#### Scenario: Directory structure exists
- **Given** the monorepo root directory
- **When** the global styles are initialized
- **Then** a `/shared/styles/` directory should exist
- **And** a `variables.css` file should exist in `/shared/styles/`
- **And** the directory should be documented in the project README

#### Scenario: Other apps can reference global styles
- **Given** multiple apps exist in the monorepo (www, other sections)
- **When** an app needs to use shared styles
- **Then** it should be able to import from `/shared/styles/`
- **And** the import path should work both locally and from the bucket

### Requirement: The variables.css file MUST define CSS custom properties for design tokens

The variables.css file SHALL define comprehensive CSS custom properties covering colors, typography, spacing, and breakpoints to establish a consistent design system.

#### Scenario: Color palette is defined
- **Given** the variables.css file
- **When** it is loaded
- **Then** it should define custom properties for primary colors
- **And** it should define custom properties for secondary/accent colors
- **And** it should define custom properties for neutral colors (grays)
- **And** it should define custom properties for semantic colors (success, error, warning, info)

#### Scenario: Typography tokens are defined
- **Given** the variables.css file
- **When** it is loaded
- **Then** it should define font-family custom properties
- **And** it should define font-size custom properties for different scales
- **And** it should define font-weight custom properties
- **And** it should define line-height custom properties

#### Scenario: Spacing tokens are defined
- **Given** the variables.css file
- **When** it is loaded
- **Then** it should define spacing custom properties using a consistent scale
- **And** the scale should cover common spacing needs (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)

#### Scenario: Breakpoint tokens are defined
- **Given** the variables.css file
- **When** it is loaded
- **Then** it should define custom properties for responsive breakpoints
- **And** breakpoints should include mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes
- **And** breakpoint values should be consistent across all apps

### Requirement: CSS custom properties MUST follow consistent, semantic naming conventions

All CSS custom properties SHALL use kebab-case naming following a predictable pattern that clearly indicates category, variant, and state for improved developer experience.

#### Scenario: Naming pattern is semantic
- **Given** a CSS custom property in variables.css
- **When** it is named
- **Then** it should use kebab-case
- **And** it should follow the pattern `--category-variant-state` (e.g., `--color-primary-500`, `--spacing-lg`)
- **And** it should be self-documenting and readable

#### Scenario: Variables use theming patterns
- **Given** the variables.css file
- **When** defining colors and themes
- **Then** root-level variables should be defined in `:root` selector
- **And** variables should support light/dark mode if applicable
- **And** naming should indicate usage context (e.g., `--color-bg-primary`, `--color-text-primary`)

### Requirement: The variables.css file MUST include clear documentation for maintainability

Comprehensive comments and documentation SHALL explain the purpose, usage, and structure of CSS variables to ensure maintainability and ease of adoption by other developers.

#### Scenario: Variables are documented
- **Given** the variables.css file
- **When** a developer opens it
- **Then** a header comment should explain the purpose and usage
- **And** sections should be clearly labeled (Colors, Typography, Spacing, etc.)
- **And** complex or calculated values should have explanatory comments

#### Scenario: Usage examples are provided
- **Given** the variables.css file or accompanying README
- **When** a developer needs to use global styles
- **Then** example import statements should be documented
- **And** example usage of variables should be shown
- **And** the bucket path structure should be explained

### Requirement: The global styles MUST contain only truly shared variables, not component-specific styles

The global styles SHALL remain focused on design tokens and universally applicable variables, avoiding component-specific styles or utility classes to maintain clarity and prevent scope creep.

#### Scenario: Only design tokens are included
- **Given** the variables.css file
- **When** reviewed for scope
- **Then** it should contain only design tokens (variables)
- **And** it should NOT contain component styles or utility classes
- **And** it should NOT include reset/normalize CSS in variables.css

#### Scenario: Additional shared CSS files are optional
- **Given** the `/shared/styles/` directory
- **When** additional shared styles are needed (reset, utilities)
- **Then** they should be in separate files (reset.css, utilities.css)
- **And** apps should be able to import them selectively
- **And** variables.css should remain focused on tokens only

### Requirement: Global styles MUST be structured for deployment to a private bucket and accessible via URL

Global styles SHALL be organized with predictable paths and CORS-compatible structure for deployment to a private bucket, allowing apps to import styles via HTTP(S) URLs.

#### Scenario: Files are deployment-ready
- **Given** the global styles files
- **When** they are uploaded to the bucket
- **Then** file paths should be predictable and documented
- **And** files should be importable via HTTP(S) URLs
- **And** CORS headers should be considered for cross-origin imports

#### Scenario: Local development uses bucket paths
- **Given** a developer working locally
- **When** they pull from the bucket via post-pull hook
- **Then** files should be placed in `/shared/styles/` locally
- **And** import paths in apps should work both locally and from bucket
- **And** development should not require manual path switching

### Requirement: Global styles in /shared/styles/ MUST be excluded from git commits

The `/shared/styles/` directory SHALL be excluded from version control to keep the repository clean, with files managed through bucket synchronization via git hooks.

#### Scenario: Global styles are gitignored
- **Given** the repository `.gitignore` file
- **When** global styles are created
- **Then** `/shared/styles/` should be listed in `.gitignore`
- **And** git status should not show these files as untracked
- **And** pre-commit hook should prevent accidental commits

#### Scenario: Documentation is version controlled
- **Given** documentation about global styles
- **When** changes are made to structure or conventions
- **Then** README or docs should be committed to git
- **And** docs should explain how to access styles from bucket
- **And** examples should be kept up-to-date
